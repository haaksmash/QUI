	You described the domain well and motivated it. You had clearly thought
about the project. I felt the teaser could have benefited from a little more
formal organization.

Project plan (milestone 3)

Comments:
I really like this project. I think it's well-motivated, and you've picked a
nice portion of the programming-languages/databases integration problem on
which to focus. As far as your write-up is concerned, I have five comments:
	(0) You mentioned decorators and meta-programming in your plan and in your
class discussion. Here are some resources, if you haven't seen these already:
		Class decorators:

	    Note that meta-class programming, in particular may be useful, of which
class decorators are one way to do them. Feel free to ask me if you have
questions.
		
	(1) It's not clear *what* is the mapping from classes to "database things".
This element is a huge part of the project. In your final version, you'll need
to include a description of the specific backend structure (e.g., S3 or
AppEngine), as well as a description of how classes are mapped to this
structure. A diagram could go a long way, here. Also, is it *classes* that are
stored in the database, or instances of those classes. In other words, in your
project, does a class correspond to a schema (i.e., a description of the data),
as is common in object-relational mapping; or is it actually classes correspond
to the bulk of the data? In general, Section 2.2 didn't contain enough specific
information for me to understand it.  
	
	(2) You mentioned a few object-relational tools, which is good. You should
also reference them, i.e., some resource by which the reader can verify your
claim and learn more about these tools. Provide the most specific references
you can. 
	
	(3) You can improve the writing in a few ways:
		(a) The write-up contains some run-on sentences, which you should
divide into separate, shorter sentences. In many cases, you can convert a
semi-colon to a period. In at least one case (the first sentence of Section
2.1), the write-up contains an incomplete sentence.
		(b) In general, the writing could be tightened up a bit. I don't mind
the informal tone (e.g., using contractions, etc.), as long as the writing is
clear and concise. There are a few places were the writing has a
stream-of-consciousness feel, which should be edited. As a small example, it's
not necessary to write "as we said before" when re-iterating a point. 
		(c) Nitpicky: In a few places, you intended to use the emphasis dash,
but you used a hyphen. You can get LaTeX to display the emphasis dash using
three hyphen, like so: ---
	
	(4) I have serious concerns about the gladiatorial battle. If this is a
battle to the death, then it strikes me as extremely unfair to the winner, who
will be left to finish the project alone.

Design / implementation discussion (milestone 4)

Comments:
	I think you organized your presentation well between the two of you. You
described the problem and motivated it well. I think you could have done more
to solicit audience participation. Obviously, being the last group to present
made it difficult, but I also think you could have done a bit more to help the
audience help you. In particular, I think your presentation made it difficult
to follow your syntactic design and your plan to map from classes to the
computational model. Also, some more specific questions for your audience would
have been helpful (you belatedly remembered a specific question you had for us,
but without clear context, it was difficult to follow).

	You could address this in the final presentation / demo, with a few slides
or board-written examples and diagrams.
